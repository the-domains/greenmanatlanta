            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>MAKING A DIFFERENCE</h1><p>We believe our products are healthy solutions for the air, surfaces, fabrics, pets and people within your home–and for the community and environment outside of it. As a pioneer in environmental responsibility, we want our service to make a difference.  We are always evaluating how to reduce our environmental impact, increase performance and safety, and create a more sustainable way of life. We believe it is our responsibility to set a course for a more mindful way of doing business, where companies act as partners with clients to create a brighter future for the whole planet.</p></article>]]></description>
